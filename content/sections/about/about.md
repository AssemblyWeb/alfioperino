I'm <u><b></b>Alfio Perino</b></u>, an User Interface Designer & Developer.

Passionate about web development, I continue to want to bring color to the dark side of programming by combining just the right amount of technique, intuition, and creativity, seasoned with CSS and Javascript.

I studied design at the University of Palermo in Buenos Aires and after spending time in both the United States and Italy I returned to Argentina.

Self-learning and continuous education are my mantras.
