## What is a the OWASP top 10?

The OWASP Top 10 is a standard that developers and web security experts use to understand the most critical risks that web applications face. It's sort of like a cheat sheet for web security. It's really useful for making sure that your web application is secure and doesn't have any major vulnerabilities.

In this post, I'm going to dive into the OWASP Top 10 list and provide some code examples in JS to illustrate each risk. So if you're a web developer looking to improve your application's security, or just curious about the most critical risks facing web apps, keep reading!

## A01:2021-Broken Access Control

Think of your house's front door. The lock on your front door controls who can enter and exit your house. If the lock is working correctly, only those who have a key or know the combination can enter. This is similar to access control in web applications. Access control ensures that only authorized users can access certain parts of the application or perform certain actions.

Now, imagine if the lock on your front door was broken, and anyone could simply walk in without any restriction. This is similar to broken access control in web applications. If access control is not implemented correctly, attackers can gain access to sensitive data or functionality that they should not have access to.

So, just as it's important to have a properly functioning lock on your front door to protect your home, it's crucial to implement strong access control measures in web applications to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

Essentially, you should provide users with the minimum amount of permissions necessary to carry out their intended tasks, and no more.

Here's an example of a bad implementation of access control in an Express.js application:

```
  app.get('/admin', (req, res) => {
    if (req.user.role === 'admin') {
      res.render('admin-dashboard');
    } else {
      res.status(403).send('Access denied');
    }
  });
```

In this example, the server checks if the user role is 'admin' to grant access to the admin dashboard. However, this approach is flawed because anyone can access the admin dashboard by simply changing their user role to 'admin' in the browser's developer console or intercepting the request and modifying it.

Here's an example of a better implementation that includes proper access control:

```
app.get('/admin', checkAdminRole, (req, res) => {
  res.render('admin-dashboard');
});

function checkAdminRole(req, res, next) {
  if (req.user.role === 'admin') {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(403).send('Access denied');
  }
}
```

In this example, a middleware function called checkAdminRole is used to check if the user role is 'admin' before granting access to the admin dashboard. This approach is more secure because the user cannot modify their role on the client-side, and the check is done on the server-side.

## A01:2021-Cryptographic failures

## What are the benefits?

There are several benefits of using a proxy server:

Improved Security: A proxy server can act as a firewall, providing an extra layer of protection for your network by intercepting incoming traffic and blocking potentially malicious requests. It can also be used to mask your IP address and encrypt your internet traffic, making it more difficult for others to intercept or spy on your online activity.

Anonymity: A proxy server can help you maintain your privacy and anonymity online by masking your IP address and other identifying information, which can be used to track your online activity.

Faster Internet: A proxy server can cache frequently accessed websites and files, which can reduce the amount of data that needs to be downloaded from the internet. This can lead to faster load times and better performance, especially for users with slow internet connections.

Content Filtering: A proxy server can be used to block or filter specific types of internet traffic, such as websites, email or instant messaging services, which can help organizations control access to certain types of content and prevent unwanted traffic.

Access Control: A proxy server can be used to restrict access to specific websites or resources, making it easier to manage and control access to certain parts of the internet. This can be useful for organizations that need to restrict access to certain websites or services for security or productivity reasons.

Overall, a proxy server can be a powerful tool for improving security, privacy, and performance on the internet, while also providing greater control over internet traffic and access to specific resources.

## Proxy Vs VPN

Proxies are generally faster than VPNs, but may not provide the same level of security or privacy.

VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure, encrypted connection between a client and a remote server. VPNs provide both privacy and security by encrypting all internet traffic between a client and a remote server, making it more difficult for others to intercept or spy on the traffic.

In summary, both proxies and VPNs can be used to hide a client's IP address and location, but VPNs provide a higher level of security and privacy by encrypting all internet traffic between a client and a remote server. Proxies are generally faster and can be configured on a per-application or per-browser basis, while VPNs are slower but provide more comprehensive protection for all internet traffic.
